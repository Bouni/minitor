# Minitor Examples

A few examples of advanced Minitor configuration using Docker Compose.

These are all built against the local version and not Docker Hub. Before you try anything here, run `make docker-build` from the root `minitor` directory so that the `minitor-dev` image is built on your local host.

If you are trying to deploy these configs and you would like to use the public image instead, change `minitor-dev` to `iamthefij/minitor`.
